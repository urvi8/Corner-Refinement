# Corner Refinement

Understanding and improving biased behavior of corner detectors

# Background and Objective

Standard corner detectors e.g. Harris sometimes produce biased estimation of corners. These detectors detect actual corners under very specific conditions and are often not scale invariant. The goal is to understand why the detector mentioned above is biased and find an alternative which exhibits better behavior.
